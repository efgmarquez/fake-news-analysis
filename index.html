              <p>
                Since 2016, there have been numerous mis/disinformation tweets regarding <b>Marcos Sr.'s Last Will and Testament</b>. In particular, tweets have been circulating, stating that 
                Marcos Sr.'s wealth will be used for national and humanitarian projects, according to his last will, in an attempt to bring another Marcos into power. However, the late dictator's last will, in fact, specifically stated that all of his estate
                <b>"of every nature and kind"</b> will be bequathed to his wife and four children.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                The spread of these misinformative tweets contribute to the rampant problem of <b>information disorder</b> in our country. Especially that these tweets propagate in a <b>political</b> nature, misinformation about powerful political images could greatly affect people's collective <b>beliefs</b> and  
                the country's <b>political landscape</b>.

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                The <b>potential implications</b> of disinformation in the <b>political landscape</b> especially during elections make it imperative that these phenomena's seasons & clusters be observed. Hence, our group aims to analyze
                these misinformative tweets to understand the trends and patterns among them that could potentially help with <b>fake news counter-propagation measures</b>.

          <h2>Let's talk about our data science methodology.</h2>

            This is how we preprocessed our data.

                ><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt=""
              /></a>
              <h3><a href="#">Data Cleaning</a></h3>
              <p>The timestamps and other relevant dates were converted to Asia/Manila time. New fields: <i>is_image, is_video, is_reply and is_url</i> were created from columns denoting the presence of each. These values were then congregated into <i>'Tweet Type'</i> which contains a comma delimited list of ['Image', 'Video', 'Reply', 'URL'].
                <br><br>
                Some columns were dropped, namely: "Link Redirect", "Reviewer", "Review", 
                "Remarks", "Rating", "Reasoning",
                "Tweet Translated", "Screenshot", "Views"; 
                because they were either extraneous or null columns. 
              </p>
              <p>All fields with scraped/entered values were observed for null values using the <i>ydata-profiling</i> package. This allowed us to observe the composition of each feature. From there, we filled null <i>Location</i> and <i>Account bio</i> with empty strings, and engagement metrics (<i>Likes, Retweets, Replies and Quote Retweets</i>) with 0.</p>
              <p>In compiling numerical data, we chose to keep outliers as they may be telling of a non-linear trend in the dataset or indicative of a text/thematic feature that has yet to be determined. In keeping the outlier values (especially for engagement), we took careful note of <b>not normalizing, scaling or standardizing</b> data features as this would
              diminish values possibly belonging to the interquartile range by dividing over the outlier value/s. Because engagement metrics in particular were left-skewed, we chose to leave them unscaled.</p>
              <p>For categorical values, the Content type column was one-hot encoded as it is a binary variable. This made it easier to produce time-series charts for this trend. For the Tweet type column, multiple subcolumns (is_reply, is_text, is_link, is_media) were used to encode it
               as tweets can be combinations of any of these three fields (e.g. tweets containing images and text, or links in reply to the previous tweet, etc.).

              <h3><a href="#">Text Feature Generation</a></h3>
              <p>The <i>mentions</i> and <i>hashtags</i> columns were created through regex extraction of those elements from the main tweet. The <i>Tweet Translated</i> field was also generated by translating the original tweet text through <b>deep_translator.GoogleTranslator</b> from Filipino to English.</p>
              <p>Further preprocessing removed links, punctuation and stop words from the translated tweet. Words were notably <b>not lemmatized</b> as the dimensionality of text features is within the acceptable range. Reducing words to their roots remove crucial information regarding the tense and context (especially for homonyms).</p>
              <p>The tweet text itself was also split from the alt-image text in the same field through regex extraction to account for the reading experience of the viewers which directly contribute to engagement.</p>

              /></a>
              <h3><a href="#">NLP</a></h3>
              <p>The processed tweet content is fed through <b>CountVectorizer</b> and <b>TfidfVectorizer</b> which count each word associated with the tweet per row and perform TF-IDF for more interpretable results. Only the 1-gram is used as tweets do not require as much sequential context. However, 2-3 grams may be further explored.</p>
              <p>The TF-IDF processed table was taken as input for <b>Principal Component Analysis</b>. This proved to be inconclusive, however, due to the small sample size. This could, however, be used for developing a machine learning model using these features. It was determined that <b>83 components</b> can be derived from the 648 words that were part of the dataset to explain its variance.</p>

The tweets peaked at October 2021, the period where Marcos filed for candidacy for the 2022 elections. It could be observed that there is an increase of frequencies of fake news tweets about Marcos’ Last Will during election seasons, those in which Bongbong Marcos is running. </p>

              <h3><a href="#">Pair Plots</a></h3>
              <p>
                We obtained the variables with correlations from the heat map and plotted them in these pair plots to better visualize their relationship. From the pair plots, we can see that the pairs of variables with a relatively high/strong positive correlation are Following and Followers, and Replies and Quote Tweets. The high positive correlation of Replies and Quote Tweets may indicate that the number of replies and quote tweets are indicators of the good engagement of the fake news tweet. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The pairs of variables with a moderate positive correlation are Followers and Quote Tweets, Following and Quote Tweets, Likes and Retweets, and Retweets and Quote Tweets. This may indicate that the amount of followers and following an account has may dictate the amount of Quote Tweets engagement the fake news tweet receives. Also, Likes and Retweets and Retweets and Quote Tweets are pairs of variables that moderately (and positively) affect each other, indicating that these engagements can be observed to increase together in a fake news tweet.

              <p>Marcos Sr.'s immediate relatives: Imelda Marcos, his wife, and Marcos Jr., his son, topped the mentions. Imelda was shown as the advocate for the release of the wealth, while Marcos Jr. was portrayed as the one who would be able to claim the alleged wealth for the Filipino people - of course, only upon election. </p>
              <p>The 'foundation' varies according to context: for some, it is where the Marcos wealth was stored while for others, it would supposedly be the institution used to distribute the wealth. The 'government', 'bank' and 'legislature' mentions were part of claims to legitimize the origin of the wealth and its due release to the public.</p>
              <p>The succeeding mentions until 'politicians' save for 'duterte', 'switzerland' constitute those who stand in opposition to the supposed release of the Marcos fund to the PH Government while the last set of mentions contain personalities used to further craft the Marcos wealth origin story.</p>
              <p><b>Finding:</b> It seems that the Marcos wealth story is perpetrated to associate the remaining Marcos kin to the promise of progress - all the while painting a story through the linked institutions and antagonizing those who stand in opposition to the Marcoses.</p>

              <h4>Research Question 1A </h4>
              <p><b>Finding:</b> A linear trendline was plotted to show the trend in engagement metrics. From observation, there may be no correlation between the number of mentioned personalities/institutions and engagements. However, this may be due to a limitation in sample size or vocabulary.</p>

              <h3><a href="">What do the tweets with misinformation about Marcos's wealth and last will have in common in terms of year it was tweeted?</a></h3>
              <h4>Research Question 2C </h4>
              <p><b>Finding:</b><br>
                The data was grouped into two groups: <b>election seasons (2016, 2019, 2021, 2022)</b> and <b>non-election seasons (2017, 2018, 2020)</b>, and the <b>Independent Samples T-test</b> was used to test whether the two groups are statistically different.<br><br>

                The <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> shows that the election seasons group has a p-value of <b>0.9917</b> while the non-election seasons has a p-value of <b>0.8428</b>,
                suggesting that both groups follow a normal distribution (since both p-values are greater than 0.05).

                The <b>Independent Samples T-test</b> showed a T-statistic of 1.7318 with a p-value of 0.1438. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05,
                we conclude that there are no significant difference or increase on the number of fake news tweets during election years.<br><br>

                However, if we only consider <b>presidential elections seasons</b> for the former group, i.e. <b>election seasons (2016, 2021, 2022)</b> and <b>non-election seasons (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)</b>, we found different results.

                The <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> still confirms that both groups follow a normal distribution, with a p-value of 0.8168 and 0.2407, respectively.
                
                The <b>Independent Samples T-test</b> showed a T-statistic of <b>4.2040</b> and a p-value of <b>0.0084</b>, which is less than 0.05. 
                This shows that the frequency of misinformation tweets during <b>national elections seasons</b> are statistically and significantly different and higher than regular years. <br><br>

                Note that in 2019, during the midterm elections, Imee Marcos ran as senator. However, there are significantly less tweets during this period, increasing the standard deviation of the former election seasons group, and
                thus making it statistically insignificant from the former non-elections group. But considering national election seasons only, we can now see the statistical difference from the latter groups. Therefore, this indicates
                that <b>the increase of tweet frequency could be associated with Bongbong Marcos running for a more powerful position (Vice President in 2016 and President in 2022)</b>--positions that have more power in "fulfilling" the late dictator's last will.
